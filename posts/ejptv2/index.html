In this article, I want to share my insights and thoughts on this certification for those considering a career in cybersecurity.\nWhat is eJPTv2? eJPTv2, short for eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester V2, is a certification program offered by eLearnSecurity. Designed for aspiring cybersecurity professionals, particularly those interested in penetration testing, this certification stands out for its practical approach and comprehensive coverage of essential topics.\nThe certification curriculum covers a diverse array of domains, making it an excellent choice for beginners:\nTCP/IP IP Routing LAN Protocols and Equipment HTTP and Web Technologies Penetration Testing Methodologies and Processes Vulnerability Assessment Exploitation with Metasploit Manual Web Application Exploitation Information Gathering and Reconnaissance Target Scanning and Profiling Course and Exam Overview The eJPTv2 certification journey begins with an online course encompassing over 150 hours of video training, addressing the domains mentioned above. It offers a progressive learning path, making it suitable for both newcomers and those with some prior knowledge.\nThe course allows for flexibility by enabling subtitles and adjusting video playback speed. However, be aware that there might be some content repetition between certain modules.\nThe certification exam consists of 35 questions, which must be completed within 45 hours. To earn the eJPTv2 certification, you need to achieve a minimum score of 70%. One notable advantage is that the exam is unsupervised, and you are permitted to access your notes during the test.\nThe results become available immediately upon submitting your exam answers. In my experience, I completed the exam in less than 4 hours, leaving sufficient time even for complete novices to finish it within the 45-hour timeframe.\nShould I take it ? The relevance of the eJPTv2 certification largely depends on your current skill level. If you are a newcomer to the cybersecurity field, this certification serves as an excellent entry point as it covers fundamental concepts comprehensively. However, if you already possess experience or similar certifications, you might find it relatively straightforward.\nIn my case, prior participation in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box had provided me with valuable experience. As a result, the eJPTv2 certification felt relatively easy, with the only notable challenge being pivoting, a skill I had not fully mastered.\nExam Preparation Resources For those preparing for the eJPTv2 exam, several resources can be beneficial. Here are two valuable links:\nList of TryHackMe Machines: Utilize these machines for practice. My Personal Cheat Sheet: I created this cheat sheet during the course and found it invaluable during the exam. Conclusion In conclusion, eJPTv2 is an ideal certification for beginners seeking to enter the world of cybersecurity. However, for individuals with prior experience and similar certifications, it may seem less relevant. It offers a good balance between theory and practice, with the practical exam being an excellent test of your penetration testing skills.\nIf you‚Äôre considering taking this exam, I wish you the best of luck in your eJPTv2 journey üôè.\n","wordCount":"504","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-05-09T11:58:47+07:00","dateModified":"2023-05-09T11:58:47+07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://s4my9.github.io/posts/ejptv2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"S4MY9's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s4my9.github.io/favicon/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://s4my9.github.io/ accesskey=h title="S4MY9 (Alt + H)">S4MY9</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://s4my9.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://s4my9.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://s4my9.github.io/posts/about/ title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://s4my9.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://s4my9.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>[üéì] EJPTv2</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-05-09 11:58:47 +0700 +0700'>May 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;504 words</div></header><div class=post-content><p>One week ago, I successfuly passed the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester V2 (eJPTv2) certification exam.
